# Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains all of my custom implementations of various different machine learning algorithms. It serves as a learning opporotunity and a way to express these concepts as modularized, easy-to-understand code.

## Included Algorithms

# Neural Network
An implementation of a fully-connected deep neural network that is styled after Keras.

It currently allows for multi-layered networks to be easily created and trained.

Examples can be seen under `neural_network/examples`.
