# Machine Learning Algorithms
This repository contains all of my custom implementations of various different machine learning algorithms. It serves as a learning opporotunity and a way to express these concepts as modularized, easy-to-understand code.


## Included Algorithms

### 1. Neural Network
An implementation of a fully-connected deep neural network that is styled after Keras.

It currently allows for multi-layered networks to be easily created and trained. Features dense layers (fully-connected layers) and activation layers. Currently only supports MSE as a cost function, but is able to support custom activation functions and weight+bias initialization methods.

Examples can be seen under `neural_network/examples`.
